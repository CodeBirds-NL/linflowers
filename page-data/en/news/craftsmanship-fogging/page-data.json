This hardly requires any extra energy so we can do this in a sustainable way. Depending on ambient temperatures, we use more or less fogging. Thus, we can guarantee a constant temperature and control the duration of growth periods. Naturally, our employees also enjoy this cooling system in the summer months!</p>\n","featured_media":null,"excerpt":"<p>The average growing time for chrysanthemums is 10 weeks.
